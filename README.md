## Java

This year my main project in java was a weather app using a custom api coded by me. The features include a five day weather forecast, a radar (WIP, not ready yet), and alerts.

## Python

This year I focused on API development in python. I wanted to make an API that created a collection of different weather APIs and then allowed you to querey multiple apis at the same time to get a more complete overview of the current weather and conditions. 

I also made some art in python this year, including a map of rome for my Mom using the prettymaps module.

## Linux

I only started to focus on Linux and making my own operating system in the last few weeks of DMA. But in that time I was able to make a simple respin of Arch Linux, using a fork of a tool called ALCI ([GitHub - arch-linux-calamares-installer/alci-iso: Arch Linux Calamares Installer](https://github.com/arch-linux-calamares-installer/alci-iso)) by [Erik Dubois](https://github.com/erikdubois)). This included a simple calamares installer by Dubois and a simple desktop enviroment called Gnome (https://www.gnome.org/ ). My goal for this first iso was not to make something revolutionary, it was just to familiraise myself with some tools avalible, and to package some packages that I use the most, plus a lightwight GUI.
